# Question

Is this function safe? Why or why not?

```js
const getUser = async (userId) => {
  const url = `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const users = await response.json();
  console.log(users)
  return users;
}
getUser(-1)
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer
We are missing the error handling to handle cases where the request fails.
So while its "fine" we did not cover all of our bases.
akin to bringing your laptop to marcy but not the charger for it.
