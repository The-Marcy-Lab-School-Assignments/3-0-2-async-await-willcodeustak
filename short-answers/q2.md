# Question

This code snippet makes a fetch to get the first todo item from the JSON placeholder API. Or at least it tries to.

What is wrong with this code? 

Describe how async/await helps us avoid this mistake.

```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Fetch failed!');
    response.json();
  })
  .then(json => console.log(json))
  .catch(err => console.log(err))
```

You can run this code of course, but try not to! Try to figure out the issue on your own.

# Answer
The "response.json" is not being returned therefore the .then and .catch that follows after receive 'undefined' instead of the json data that we want. So to fix it we would just add 'return before the response.json();


async/await makes our code less error-prone and at the same time more readable being that there is less code being involved.
With async,await we avoid creating the promise all together and the nesting .then's that come with it.
We do not need to return a value into a .then because we are not chaining promises anymore.
