# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
Allows us to write asynchronous code in synchronous manner.

Without async and await we would have to use resolve, reject , .then and .catch which leads to a-lot of nested code that can be "ridden" of by using async and await. 

Javascript implicitly handles the "resolve" and "reject" when doing async and await, meaning you do not have to do it yourself - leading to less code.

TLDR: async and await simplifies/ makes more readable by...

- automatically creating promises.

- managing the resolution  and rejection of promises.

- when using await on a promise , the function execution is paused but the main event loop is not. Allowing for other operations to continue.  This is the big deal because it prevents code blocking.
